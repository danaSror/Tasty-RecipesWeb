        We are 3th year students of Software and Information Systems Engineering
        in Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
      </p>
      <p>
        We really like to create new and challenging things, and especially for
        programming.
      </p>
      This site is the last project we worked on. It consists of client and
      server side.
      <p>
        The client can receive recipes randomaly, and look for specific recipes.
      </p>
